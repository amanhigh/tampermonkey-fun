## Coding

- For Interface Methods use inherit docs in Class.
- Don't use \_ for private methods as typescript has private keyword.
- Take Care of Async Functions and match return type at integration points.
- Update Factory for Dependency Injection and any Constructor Changes. (Don't use Factory directly outside Core.)

## General

- Refer constant.ts (IDS) for UI Component Names which user will mention.
- barkat.ts and onload.ts are the main entry points.
